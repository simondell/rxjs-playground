# An RXJS playground

A handful of files to help me get into using Rx.js and some other tech as whimsy takes over.

## Dev log

1. It starts out as an HTML file with embedded JS that logs filtered array elements out to markup.
2. I decide it would be fun to wrap an Rx.Observable around data from a socket.io connection. However, I don't remember much about doing this, so I ran through [a tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/), tweaking it a little as I went.
